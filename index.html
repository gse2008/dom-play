            I even scare myself. Look at the circles under my eyes. I haven't slept in weeks.</span></p>

        <p><span data-actor="tin">Tin Man: Why don't you try counting sheep?</span></p>

        <p><span data-actor="lion">Lion: That doesn't do any good, I'm afraid of 'em.</span></p>

        <p><span data-actor="scare">Scarecrow: Oh, that's too bad.  Don't you think the Wizard could <br>
            help him, too?</span></p>

        <p><span data-actor="dory">Dorothy: I don't see why not.  Why don't you come along with us?<br>
             We're on our way to see the Wizard now. To get him a heart.</span></p>

        <p><span data-actor="tin">Tin Man: And him a brain.</span></p>

        <p><span data-actor="dory">Dorothy: I'm sure he could give you some courage.</span></p>

        <p><span data-actor="lion">Lion: Well, wouldn't you feel degraded to be seen in the company <br>
            of a cowardly lion?  I would.</span></p>
        
        <p><span data-actor="dory">Dorothy: No, of course not.</span></p>
